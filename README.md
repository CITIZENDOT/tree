# tree

## Necessity
Oneday, I logged into a ssh session. I wanted to list a directory. But, `tree` utility isn't installed in that system. And the thing is, I am not super-user and Hence, I can't install other `apt` packages in that system. I found some `tree` scripts in github but they aren't fully functional. All they have is basic directory listing. I want to filter out some files/folders based on the Pattern, follow sym-links etc...

I guess you have understood the problem now. This script tries to mimic the behavior of `*NIX` tree utility as much as possible.
